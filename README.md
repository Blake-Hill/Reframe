#Reframe - WIP
This is a program designed to automatically add a handful of effects and alterations to a folders worth of images automatically.

I am writing it because a lot of games I play have markets with trading that takes place on second hand forums like discord. I have found that adding a bit of flare to the images of your items for trade brings more eyes to my posts. This app will make eye-catching images way quicker than I could make them individually with photoshop.
